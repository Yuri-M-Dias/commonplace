# random-quotes
The quotes that i generally find inspiring. Albeit this is a repository just to remind me to use github, though. The quotes are from anything, anywhere, they are just thoughtful or mean something. The format is a list: **"quote"**, Author(character), Where(source), (Author, if a book or something). If the first Author is a character in something, the real author is to be added after the where. I'll probably mix some languages in this.
