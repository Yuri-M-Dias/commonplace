# random-quotes
The quotes that i generally find inspiring. Albeit this is a repository just to remind me to use github, though. The quotes are from anything, anywhere, they are just thoughtful or mean something. The format is a list: **"quote"**, Author(character), Where(source), (Author, if a book or something). If the first Author is a character in something, the real author is to be added after the where. I'll probably mix some languages in this.

- **"Any physical theory is always provisional, in the sense that it is only a hypothesis: you can never prove it. No matter how many times the results of experiments agree with some theory, you can never be sure that the next time the result will not contradict the theory. On the other hand, you can disprove a theory by finding even a single observation that disagrees with the predictions of the theory. As philosopher of science Karl Popper has emphasized, a good theory is characterized by the fact that it makes a number of predictions that could in principle be disproved or falsified by observation. Each time new experiments are observed to agree with the predictions the theory survives, and our confidence in it is increased; but if ever a new observation is found to disagree, we have to abandon or modify the theory."**, Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time

##Laws
This section is kinda random, with phsysical laws that can be useful to remember and use in the day to day life:
- **Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems**. Any logical model of reality is incomplete (and possibly inconsistent) and must be continuously refined/adapted in the face of new observations. 
- **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.** In a nutshell, this principle shows that we cannot simultaneously fix or determine the velocity and position of a particle or body. We can measure coordinates or movements of those particles, but not both. As we get a more and more precise measure of one value (velocity or positions), our measurement of the other value becomes more and more uncertain. The uncertainty of one variable is created simply by the act of observation.
- **2nd Law of Thermodynamics.** Individuals or organizations that don’t communicate with the outside world by getting new information about the environment or by creating new mental models act like a "closed system". And just as a closed system in nature will have increasing entropy, or disorder, so too will a person or organization experience mental entropy or disorder if they’re cut off from the outside world and new information.
